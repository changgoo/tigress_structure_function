# TIGRESS surface density maps for structure function analysis

* The full 3D data is available at https://princetonuniversity.github.io/astro-tigress/intro.html
* We are using the 2pc resolution `MHD` data.
* Selected projected surface density maps are stored in `pickle` files and available at `data/`. More snapshots are available when needed.
* See `notebooks/example.ipynb` for a tutorial.
